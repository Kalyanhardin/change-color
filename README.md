# Change Color
This is a mini project in which it will print the color based on the input color in the input box.
Since there is a flaw in this that is when you give the color 'black' we won't see the color name and hexvalue since they are by default blank in color, so for that i used a button called toggle text color with this we can see the color name and hexvalue in white and for white it is black.
